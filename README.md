## Planning

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to sign up/in so I can play the game.

- As a user, I want to be able to start/restart the game so I can play again.
- As a user, I want the player to start as X then switch to O, every game, so we can keep the game fair with starting X player.
- As a user, I want to only be able to select available positions so that there is no overwriting.
- As a user, I want the system to display when I win/lose/tie.
- As a user, I want the board to be unclickable once the game is over.
